# live_coding_survey_analysis
This is the repo of the live coding I did for coffee and code on 4th April 2024

I have included an rds file so you can use that.

I have removed email addresses and anyone who was not an NHS employee.  Just because they were small numbers and potentially more identifiable.

Other than that, I have pretty much left it warts and all. 

The video to accompany this code can be found at https://future.nhs.uk/NHSERcommunity
